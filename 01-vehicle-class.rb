# 1. Implement a Vehicle class. It should accept make and model properties when you create an object.
# => civic = Vehicle.new("Honda", "Civic")

# 2. Implement a Car class. It should inherit from Vehicle.
# => civic = Car.new("Honda", "Civic")

# 3. Implement a Motorbike class. It should also inherit from Vehicle.
# => low_rider = Motorbike.new("Harley Davidson", "Low Rider")

# 4. Implement the following methods, but first, device where they should live.

# a. refuel (should take one argument: litres)

# b. wheelie (should display a message)

# c. wind_up_windows (should display a message)

# d. fuel_level (should display total litres in the tank)

# 5. A car should only allow maximum 50L of petrol and a bike 15L. Keep your code DRY!
# Hint: research how super works.
