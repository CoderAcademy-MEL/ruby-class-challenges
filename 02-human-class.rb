# Specs

# This challenge involves an understanding of how inheritence works through a Human class as well as two sub classes Hippy and Influencer

# It also involves utlilising the shorthand getters and setters methods

# 1. Create a Human class

# 2. Give the Human class some instance variables; eye_colour, hair_colour, height

# 3. We want to be able to READ eye_colour, hair_colour and height, and WRITE hair_colour

# 4. Create two classes, Hippy and Influencer, that inherit from Human, except an Influencer needs a shower method, whilst the Hippy needs a fire_twirl method
