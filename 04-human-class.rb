# 1. Create a Human class

# 2. Give the Human class some instance variables; eye_colour, hair_colour, height

# 3. We want to be able to READ eye_colour, hair_colour and height, and WRITE hair_colour

# 4. Create two classes, Hippy and Influencer, that inherit from Human, except an Influencer needs a shower method, whilst the Hippy needs a fire_twirl method

# 5. Seperate these into seperate files

# 6. If you're feeling wild, find a cool speech gem, that you can add to the Human class
